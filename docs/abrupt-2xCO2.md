## Forcings

<!--- TODO: auto-generate this from some common machine-readable file -->
### Source IDs

In this experiment, forcings with the following source IDs should be used:

- CR-CMIP-1-0-0

### Implementation details

<!--- TODO?: auto-generate this from some common machine-readable file? -->

The experiment should branch from the piControl experiment.
Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations 
which are double the value used in the piControl experiment should be applied.
No other forcings should be altered from their piControl values.
