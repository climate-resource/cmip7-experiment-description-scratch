Very Low Concentration Driven Scenario Extension after High Overshoot
<!--- End one-line-description -->

## Longer description

<!--- Start longer-description -->
Extension to Concentration driven scenario with similar end-of-century temperature impact to VLLO, but with less aggressive near-term mitigation and large reliance on net negative emissions, resulting in a higher overshoot.
